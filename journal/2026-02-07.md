# 2026-02-07 — Possessives: Handoff and Processing

## Session Type
Build — SYNC coordination

## What Happened

Short session. Wrote the possessives task for Code via SYNC.md, then processed Code's completed work back through the system.

### Possessives Handoff
Wrote the task: extend `apply_corrections` to strip `'s` (straight and curly apostrophes) before lookup, same shape as the existing punctuation fix. Code picked it up and completed it — added `_POSSESSIVE_S` regex, 7 new tests, 93/93 fast tests passing.

### Processing Code's Work
Moved completed possessives task from SYNC.md "From Code" → SYNC-LOG.md. Cleared "From Code". Updated CURRENT.md — possessives marked as handled, next steps reordered with full pipeline run at the top.

### Surfaced by Code
The possessive regex also matches contractions (`it's`, `he's`, `let's`). Safe because corrections only target Sanskrit proper nouns. Code documented the limitation with a comment and pinned the behavior with a characterization test.

## Key Decisions

- **Kept it simple.** Possessives are the same problem as punctuation — extra characters preventing lookup. No need to treat them differently.

## What's Next
- Full pipeline run on real audio to verify possessives (four known instances)
- Build log entry "The Living Transcript" still queued in SYNC.md
- Clean up deferred tasks (diarize test, processing stats, language detection)
