# 2026-02-01 — Course Correction: Whisper Model Confusion

## Summary
Short session to correct the record. Previous journal entries contained conclusions based on testing with the wrong Whisper model. The 189.21s "threshold" finding is invalid.

## What Was Wrong

The journal entry from 2026-01-31 documented finding an exact threshold (189.21s) where Whisper drops speech. This was based on tests that were NOT using whisper-large-v3.

Similarly, CURRENT.md claimed DeepSeek R1 8B was selected for LLM speaker correction. No such decision was made.

## Actual State

With the correct large model:
- **No speech dropping** at any audio length
- **Hallucination quality varies** — shorter clips produce incorrect words for quiet speech
- **Full session works** — correct transcription with sufficient context

This aligns with earlier understanding: Whisper needs ~3+ minutes of context not to avoid *dropping* speech, but to get the *words right* for quiet speakers.

## LLM Speaker Correction

No model has successfully completed the speaker correction task. Decision still pending. Need to revisit after transcript analysis.

## What's Next

Deep dive into full session Whisper transcript to understand actual output quality before proceeding with LLM correction work.

## Technical State
- 43+ tests passing
- Need to re-examine threshold test scripts for model configuration
- Full session transcript ready for analysis
