# 2026-02-07b — Full Pipeline Validation Run

## Session Type
Build — Pipeline validation

## What Happened

Ran the full pipeline end-to-end on real audio for the first time with all normalization stages wired in. Created session `00000000-000001` (copy of original audio) to preserve the pre-normalization session for comparison.

### Results
- **LLM normalization:** 18 corrections (matches previous validation run exactly)
- **Dictionary normalization:** 15 corrections (up from 12 — possessives fix working)
- **Total:** 33 corrections, zero false positives
- **Schema:** 1.1.0 with `_processing` metadata

### Possessives Verified
The `_POSSESSIVE_S` regex fix confirmed working on real audio. Two instances of `Yudhisthir's` correctly normalized to `Yudhishthira's`. This accounts for the dictionary count increase from 12→15 (the additional 3 being Yudhisthir variants that were previously blocked by the possessive suffix).

### One More Variant
Found `Pondovas` (with 'o') in segment 63 — wasn't matching `Pondavas` (with 'a') in the dictionary. Added `Pondovas` to `mahabharata.json` under Pandavas variants. Will be caught on next run.

## Key Decisions

- **Preserved original session.** Created 00000000-000001 rather than overwriting 00000000-000000, so both pre- and post-normalization outputs exist for comparison.

## What's Next
- Build log entry "The Living Transcript" (queued in SYNC.md)
- Clean up deferred tasks (diarize test, processing stats, language detection)
- Story element extraction
