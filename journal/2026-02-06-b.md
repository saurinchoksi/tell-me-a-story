# 2026-02-06 — Normalization Runner Design + Handoff

## Session Type
Design discussion → Claude Code handoff

## What Happened

Walked through the design of the normalization runner module before handing to Code. Three design questions surfaced and resolved:

**Input shape:** Module takes a plain text string, not transcript JSON. Caller extracts text. This keeps the module schema-ignorant — simpler, not more complex. The "callable modules, loose wiring" principle from earlier playing out concretely.

**Prompt ownership:** Parameter with default value. `DEFAULT_PROMPT` constant at top of file. Zero cost now, avoids cracking open internals when a second use case arrives. "Leave infrastructure doors open" without speculative architecture.

**Error handling:** Fail Loud. `{}` from model = empty list (not an error). Timeout/garbage = raise. No retry logic in module — caller decides what to do. Consistent with project principles.

## SYNC Handoff Written

Complete task in SYNC.md for Code to build:
- `src/normalize.py` — callable module
- `tests/test_normalize.py` — mocked unit tests (no Ollama calls)

Reference files pointed to: experiment script for pattern, transcribe.py for style, test_filters.py for test style.

## Reflection

Good session for practicing the design-before-code muscle. The three questions (input shape, prompt ownership, error handling) felt like the right level of design — enough to make Code's job clear without over-specifying implementation details.
