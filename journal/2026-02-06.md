# 2026-02-06 — LLM Normalization: Segment vs Full Transcript Experiment

## The Question

Does segment-by-segment LLM processing catch more phonetic mishearings than full-transcript processing? Or does it lose too much context?

## Setup

- Model: qwen3:8b (local via Ollama)
- Test file: run_0.json (89 segments, ~5 min audio)
- Ground truth: `fondos`, `fondo`, `goros`, `yudister`, `dhrashtra`

## Results

| Approach | Recall | Caught | Missed | False Positives |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| Full transcript | 5/5 (100%) | fondos, fondo, goros, yudister, dhrashtra | — | 0 |
| Segment-by-segment | 4/5 (80%) | fondos, goros, yudister, dhrashtra | fondo* | 3 |

*fondo missed due to timeout, not model failure

**Winner: Full transcript.** Perfect recall, zero false positives, single LLM call.

## Segment-by-Segment Details

### True Positives (in ground truth)
- fondos → Pandavas ✓
- goros → Kauravas ✓
- yudister → Yudhishthira ✓
- dhrashtra → Dhritarashtra ✓

### Bonus Catches
- pondovas → Pandavas (valid mishearing not in original ground truth)

### Hindi Variants (Pass 2 territory, not mishearings)
- duryodhan → Duryodhana
- yudhisthir → Yudhishthira

### False Positives (hallucinations)
- best → Bhishma ❌ (English word)
- dad → Pandu ❌ (English word)
- father → Dhritarashtra ❌ (English word)

## Technical Issues Found

1. **Empty JSON format:** Model sometimes returns `{}` instead of `{"corrections": []}` — regex doesn't match
2. **Timeouts:** Some segments hit 120s timeout
3. **Non-determinism:** Same segment can produce different mappings on different runs (fondos/goros got swapped once)

## Conclusions

1. **Full transcript achieves 100% recall** — caught all 5 ground truth items
2. **Full transcript has 100% precision** — no false positives
3. **Segment-by-segment hallucinates** — maps English words to Sanskrit names

## Architecture Implications

**Full transcript wins definitively.** No hybrid approach needed.

Two viable paths:

**Pass 1: Full Transcript LLM**
- Single call to qwen3:8b
- Catches all phonetic mishearings
- 100% recall, 0 false positives

**Pass 2: Dictionary (Hindi variants)**
- Duryodhan → Duryodhana
- Yudhisthir → Yudhishthira
