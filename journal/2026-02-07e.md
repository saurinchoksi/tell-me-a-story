# 2026-02-07e — Pipeline End-to-End Verification

## Session Type
Build — SYNC handoff + processing results

## What Happened

Wrote SYNC handoff for Code to create session 00000000-000002 (fresh session, same audio as 000001) and run the full 4-stage pipeline from scratch. Code executed, all stages succeeded, schema 1.2.0 confirmed.

### Spot-Check Results
All three matched expectations:
- "Right." (hallucination) → UNKNOWN, coverage 0.0
- "Duryodhana." (real speech) → SPEAKER_01, coverage 0.829
- "Well." (hallucination overlapping real speech) → SPEAKER_00, coverage 1.0

### Key Surfaced Detail
Two consecutive "Well."s — real (prob 0.993, coverage 0.227 at 24.76s) then hallucinated (prob 0.133, coverage 1.0 at 25.58s). Confirms coverage alone can't catch all hallucinations. Future hallucination marking needs low prob + coverage context combined.

Processed From Code into SYNC-LOG. Updated CURRENT.md.

## What's Next
- Process more audio sessions for ground truth corpus
- Build log mockups review (content work)
- Eventually: confidence/hallucination marking stage
