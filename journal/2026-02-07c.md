# 2026-02-07c — Hallucination Review & Build Log Processing

## Session Type
Build — Hallucination analysis review, SYNC processing

## What Happened

### Build Log Processed
Code completed the "Two Lanes, Zero Overlap" / "The Living Transcript" build log entry. Verified the output on the log page — correction flow visual, two-pass table, JSON code block all present. Moved task from SYNC.md → SYNC-LOG.md. Cleared "For Code" section. SYNC is now empty.

### Hallucination Report Review
Re-read `experiments/hallucination_analysis_report_1.md` (from Feb 3) and mapped every finding against the current pipeline code. Key discovery: **zero hallucination detection exists in the pipeline.** The report recommended three detection mechanisms — none were built. The normalization work took priority.

Checked `transcribe.py`, `filters.py`, `query.py`, and `pipeline.py` to confirm:
- `clean_transcript()` only removes zero-duration words and empty segments
- `filters.py` has `min_probability()` but it's never called in the pipeline
- `query.py` accepts `word_filter` but `pipeline.py` doesn't pass one
- No duplicate detection, no segment-level flagging, no hallucination markers

### Actionable Items Document
Produced `experiments/hallucination-actions.md` with 6 items:
1. Low-probability fabrications (3/4 catchable, nothing built)
2. Consecutive duplicate segments (nothing built)
3. High-confidence hallucination (the hard one — prob 0.745, may need human stage)
4. Missing quiet speech (hardware problem, not pipeline)
5. Pipeline stage architecture (where does marking fit in the sequence?)
6. Query-time filtering vs pipeline-time marking (philosophy gates everything)

Key tension: the report was written before the "enriched transcript" architecture. Its "delete < 0.2" recommendation conflicts with "never destroy data." Item 6 (philosophy) needs to be settled first.

## Key Decisions

- **Hallucination is next before cleanup.** Reordered next steps. This is a real pipeline gap — the report identified it weeks ago and nothing's been done.
- **Start with philosophy (Item 6)**, then low-prob flagging (Item 1), then duplicates (Item 2). Items 3-4 can wait.

## What's Next
- Work through hallucination items, starting with the mark-vs-delete philosophy question
- Then implement low-prob flagging and duplicate detection as pipeline stages
