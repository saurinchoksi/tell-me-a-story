# 2026-02-02 — Transcript Analysis & Validation Tool Spec

## Summary
Deep dive into raw Whisper transcript output. Verified first 50 words against audio, then spec'd a dedicated transcription validation tool. Handed off to Claude Code for implementation.

## Transcript Analysis

Examined `sessions/debug/00000000-000000/03-transcript.json` — the raw Whisper output before diarization.

**Key observations from first 50 words:**

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| 4-second gap (3.84s - 8.14s) | Real silence, not missing speech |
| "Dad" at 0.11 probability | Correctly transcribed despite very low confidence — Whisper hears quiet speech |
| fondos/goros confidence increases | First occurrence ~0.71-0.77, repeat at 0.99 — Whisper "locks in" wrong spelling |
| Duryodhan correct at 0.77 | Sanskrit name captured properly, unlike Pandavas/Kauravas |

**Decision:** Validate transcription first, before tackling name correction. Need to know the underlying capture is solid.

## Tool Design

Spec'd a transcription-only validator, separate from the existing combined tool. Key features:

- **1-minute sliding window** — Main waveform shows 60 seconds, auto-follows playback
- **Minimap** — Full session overview for navigation
- **Click word → immediate play** — No separate play click needed
- **Probability color-coding** — Green (≥0.9), Yellow (0.5-0.9), Red (<0.5)
- **Notes per segment** — Free-form text tied to segment index

Architecture follows existing `validation-player.html` + `validation-server.py` pattern.

**Location:** `tools/chat/transcript_validator/` — the `chat/` folder marks this as a workflow experiment (spec in Chat, build in Code).

## Workflow Experiment

Testing whether spec'ing in Claude Chat before handing to Claude Code produces different/better results than building directly in Code. This tool is the test case.

## What's Next

1. Claude Code builds the tool from SYNC.md spec
2. Use tool to validate full transcript
3. Design diarization validation tool (separate concern)
4. Eventually: name correction strategy

## Technical State
- 43+ tests passing
- SYNC.md updated with full spec for Code
- No code changes this session (design only)
