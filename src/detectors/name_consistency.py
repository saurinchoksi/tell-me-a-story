"""M9b — inconsistent-name detector.

Catches an improvised story name spelled several ways within one recording —
the engines Jiraki/Jameis/Jammus, or a name Whisper renders one way here and
another there. Unlike the M9a detector there is no roster and no truth source:
the *only* defect is inconsistency, so the detector flags it and leaves the
choice of a winning spelling to a separate fix.

Mechanism (code-only, no model): group the recording's capitalized tokens into
phonetic clusters by shared Double Metaphone code; a cluster spelled more than one
way is inconsistent. We flag only the *deviating* occurrences: if one spelling is
the recording's majority (used in more than half the occurrences), it is treated as
the intended one and its occurrences are NOT flagged — only the odd spellings are.
With no clear majority (spellings scattered, no winner), every occurrence is flagged
so the unsettled name can be reviewed. A name spelled one consistent way is never
flagged. The majority is a *within-recording* call about what to surface, never a
global canonical — settling one spelling per character across recordings is a
separate concern (cross-session consistency).

Family-roster names are EXCLUDED (deferred to the m9a detector): a roster match —
the child's or a parent's name and its misspellings — is dropped before clustering,
so m9b reports only *improvised* inconsistency and never double-counts a family name
m9a already owns. The exclusion is graceful: with no roster file, m9b falls back to
its original roster-agnostic behavior. Flags can still echo improvised story names,
so the per-session detections.json stays under gitignored sessions/.
