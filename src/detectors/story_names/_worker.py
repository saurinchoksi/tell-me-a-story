"""Offline worker for the per-story name auditor — runs in a fresh subprocess.

`run(session_dir)` is invoked via model_runner.run_model from CanonNameDetector: a
spawned subprocess of this venv, so its Gemma load gets a clean GPU process and frees
it on exit. In ONE model load it (1) takes the pipeline's saved story regions
(`_stories`), or segments live as a fallback for older sessions, (2) per story builds
recall-recovered name cards and runs the v2 audit (+ canon shield), (3) EXPANDS each
per-spelling verdict to the standard per-occurrence flag schema (segment_id/word_index/
...), and RETURNS {n_word_tokens, flags}. Diagnostics go to stderr; a __main__ block
prints the JSON for standalone debugging.

The flag-expansion (the one production-specific adaptation) and the region adapter live
here; the validated logic is imported from story_segment and the ported _audit/_names
modules.
