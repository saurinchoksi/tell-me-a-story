"""Stage-1 per-story name auditor — the v2 architecture only.

PORTED from the sealed EMP probe emp/src/audit_names.py. Only the validated v2
path is copied: the worksheet over RECALL-RECOVERED cards, then a CANON SHIELD that
removes correctly-spelled real names from the inconsistency (M9b) flags only. The
three eval-only architectures (worksheet/fulltext/hybrid), the sweep orchestration
(`audit_session`), and the CLI (`main`) are dropped — this module is imported by the
worker, never run standalone.

Detects, per story, in one local-LLM pass:
  - M9c: a real canon name (Thomas & Friends, Mahabharata, …) SPELLED WRONG.
  - M9b: ONE improvised name spelled SEVERAL different ways.

FIREWALL: reads the transcript + the live Stage-0 regions ONLY. Never the answer key.
LOCAL-ONLY: Gemma-4 E4B via MLX under venv-mlx-vlm; family content never leaves the machine.
