"""Name-candidate generation + story-region helpers for the per-story name auditor.

PORTED from the sealed EMP probes: `proper_name_candidates` / `detect_phrases` /
`PHRASE_STOP` / `MIN_NAME_LEN` / `SENT_END` come from emp/src/name_truth.py, and
`seg_word_text` / `story_segments` from emp/src/audit_common.py. Only the functions
the v2 audit path actually reaches are copied — the review-tool half of name_truth.py
(`collect_flags`, the HTML/audio server) and its `FamilyNameDetector` import are
deliberately NOT ported, so this module carries no dependency on the gitignored
family-name roster.

Non-negotiable encoded in seg_word_text (see emp.md "Stage 1, step 1"): read the
DELIVERED word tokens, never the segment `text`. LLM-normalization rewrites the
words but not `text` (a known pipeline bug), so `text` can still show a
pre-correction mishearing while the words show the corrected spelling.
