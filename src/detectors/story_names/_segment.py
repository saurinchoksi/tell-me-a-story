"""Stage-0 story segmenter — split a recording into its stories.

PORTED VERBATIM from the sealed EMP probe emp/src/segment.py (the family_names.py
precedent: production copies the validated eval logic, emp/ stays the eval of
record). The only changes from the original are production de-hardcodings, marked
PROD: load_segments/segment_session take a session_dir instead of an EMP session
id; the 5-session `SESSIONS` name lookup is gone (any session works now); and the
one summary print goes to stderr so the worker's stdout stays clean JSON. The CLI
(`main`), the pre-baked prediction file, and the truth sidecar are dropped — this
module is imported, never run standalone.

"Code proposes, model confirms," the same shape as the name detectors:

  1. PRE-FILTER (cheap code, high recall) — verbal cues + time-gaps + structural
     markers + recording-edge sentinels propose candidate boundary zones.
  2. READER pass 1 (local LLM) — per candidate zone, extract boundary EVENTS
     (story_start / story_end / nothing) in a small window.
  3. ASSEMBLY (deterministic code) — pair start/end events into story regions.
  4. GLOBAL MERGE (local LLM, on by default) — re-read the regions together and
     merge interruption-split halves into one story.
  5. READER pass 2 (local LLM) — per region, name the world + a title.

Output per session: stories = [{start_id, end_id, title, world, evidence}].
LOCAL-ONLY: the reader is Gemma-4 E4B via MLX, run in a fresh subprocess.

PASS1_PROMPT = """You are reading a transcript of a parent telling a young child bedtime stories, working through the recording in order, one window at a time. A recording usually holds just ONE story; occasionally a parent tells two or three, with negotiation and milk breaks between them. Each line is tagged with its segment id in [brackets]; some lines were auto-flagged as possible boundaries ("signals").

CURRENT STATE: {state}

Decide what — if anything — happens in THIS window. Be conservative: MOST windows contain no boundary.
- If NO story is open and a new story clearly BEGINS here, return a story_start. Mark the launch-cue line ("start the story", "let's tell a different story", "you help me tell it", "once upon a time"); if there is no cue, mark the first real sentence of the story. (Special case: if this window is the very START of the recording and the parent is ALREADY mid-story — story narration, no preamble, no cue — mark that first narration line as the story_start.)
- If a story IS open, you are almost always STILL INSIDE it — stories are long and full of pauses, milk breaks, repeated words, and characters talking ("That's right, said the baby" is the story, not a new one). A real-life interruption (cleaning a spill, getting milk, fixing a pillow) is STILL the same story if the telling resumes afterward — do NOT end the story for an interruption. Return a story_end ONLY when the open story clearly concludes here: it says "the end", or it gives way for good to settling-down, a sung wind-down ("I see trees of green"), or negotiating which story to tell next. A different new story may begin right after such an end.
- Otherwise return no events.

Use ONLY segment ids that appear in [brackets] below. Return JSON only, no other text:
{{"events": [{{"type": "story_start" or "story_end", "segment_id": <id>, "quote": "<the line>"}}]}}
If nothing in this window begins or ends a story, return {{"events": []}}.

- SAME story (one group): they share the same characters and plot — a later segment just CONTINUES the story after an interruption (a milk break, a spill, cleaning up, a tangent). A collaborative back-and-forth where the parent and child build ONE story together ("you help me tell it", "what happens?", "yeah, then what?") is still that same one story, not a new one.
- DIFFERENT stories (separate groups): the characters or the world clearly change (different toys, people, or settings), or someone announces a switch ("let's tell a different story", "no more ___ stories"). When unsure, keep them separate.

Segments:

Judge only whether the earlier lines are ALREADY part of THIS story — its opening question, its characters or setting being introduced, its first events, the question the story then answers. Some stories open as a question-and-answer ("why did they want to be king?" -> the parent explaining) rather than "once upon a time"; that opening question and its answer ARE the story.

The earlier lines are NOT the story if they are: chit-chat, deciding WHICH story to tell, repeated filler, or talk about something else (names, the day, getting settled). When unsure, keep the detected start.

Return JSON only: {{"start_id": <segment id of the true first line of this story>}}
