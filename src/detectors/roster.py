"""Shared family-roster matcher.

m9a (family_names.py) owns family-name detection. m9b (name_consistency.py) uses this
to EXCLUDE family-roster names from its improvised-name clustering, so the two detectors
partition cleanly — m9a = family, m9b = improvised — instead of both flagging the same
name (the child's name showed up under both before).

The match mirrors family_names.py's phonetic + alias test: a cleaned token matches the
roster iff it is a canonical form, OR its Double Metaphone codes intersect the roster's
codes (catches misspellings like Artie/Arthie), OR it is a known alias.

Graceful by design: if the roster file is absent, the matcher matches nothing and m9b
falls back to its original roster-agnostic behavior. No real names are hardcoded — the
roster is the gitignored data/name_roster.json (schema in data/name_roster.example.json).
