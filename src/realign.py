"""Forced-alignment word realignment (TMAS-50 / TMAS-54).

Whisper's per-word timestamps drift — concentrated on segment-initial words,
which land too early in the pre-speech pause (the CrisperWhisper bug: the leading
space is glued onto the next word, so the silence is parked onto it). This module
re-derives word boundaries with torchaudio's MMS_FA CTC forced aligner, which the
TMAS-50 experiment validated three independent ways (seg-initial onset 22%->66%,
re-ASR word-return 70%->90%, the "Okay," anchor 1.70s->2.08s).

It aligns from the segment's trusted **text** (what forced alignment naturally
takes), which also folds in the TMAS-53 / Mode-11 fix: `clean_transcript` prunes
zero-duration words from `words[]` but never from `text`, so re-deriving the word
list from text brings the real dropped words back with proper durations.

Safety: the EMP axial-labels ground truth binds to each segment's `id`, so this
module only ever rewrites per-word `start`/`end` and the within-segment `words[]`
list, and expands the segment time envelope outward. It never touches segment
`id`, `text`, count, or order. (The id invariant is enforced by the surgical
caller, src/realign_session.py.)

Per-segment alignment in a padded window is safe and cheap: the drift makes starts
too *early*, so the true onset is always inside the window — no quadratic full-file
pass needed.
