"""Split-prompt cast generation — the world's characters AND its groups, asked separately.

The E8 sweep (emp/results/visuals/whisper-context/notes.md) found that asking a small model
for a world's "characters" reliably drops the GROUP names — Pandavas, Kauravas, Crystal Gems,
the Foot Clan — and on the held-out Mahabharata those groups are 14 of the 36 by-ear key
corrections. No single prompt got both clean; TWO prompts did, on both Qwen and Gemma, across
all 7 swept worlds. So the cast is generated in two calls and unioned, groups first (they
matter most for correction).

Shared by the namefix correction stage and the M9c canon detector. Pure functions with an
injectable `gen` (the qwen35 reader contract); an optional on-disk cache under
`data/worlds-cache/` keyed by world slug + a prompt fingerprint, so repeat sessions in the
same world don't re-generate.
