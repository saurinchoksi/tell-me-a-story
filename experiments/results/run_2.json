  "text": " Okay, what is the question? Why do the Pandavas and the Kauravas want to be king? Uh-huh. Well... So the oldest brother of the Kauravas, his name was, do you remember? Duryodhana. Duryodhana, yeah. And the oldest brother of the Pandavas, his name is? Yudhishthira. That's right, Yudhishthira. And so the Pandavas and the Kauravas, they both wanted to be king. Meaning? Meaning they both wanted the oldest on both families to be the king. And because they both wanted the same thing, they got in lots of arguments and lots of fights, and they were not nice to each other. Does that make sense? And the reason that Yudhishthira... Yudhishthira wanted to be king, and Duryodhana wanted to be king, were not exactly the same. Duryodhana wanted to be king because he felt like he deserved it. Like it was supposed to be his. It was a little bit of his, not a little, it was a lot of his ego. And he was quite vain, just like James is, right? Duryodhana was really thoughtful. He thought that he should be king because he was the best. And then remember, I also said he was mad and resented that his father, that they had taken him away from being king. And, I mean, to his credit... The right father. The blind father. His father, what, do you remember his father's name? The Dhrasht. The? The Dhrasht. Yeah, I have to look up the pronunciation. But, remember, he was born blind. And even though he was the older one, older than Pando, they didn't let him be king in the beginning. And because... Because they took his... Being a king away... He... Duryodhana always felt like it wasn't fair. And to be honest, he thought it wasn't fair that Yudhisthira should be king because his dad, at that point, the Dhrasht, his dad, was king. So, it didn't make sense to Duryodhana that he wasn't king. So, I mean, he wasn't a great guy. But it's not like you can't understand why he kind of felt like he should be king. You can relate to him. You can have what we call empathy for him. Now, Yudhisthira, on the other hand, he thought he should be king because his father had been made king. And then because... Because his father had to go away, it was kind of... Huh? Yudhisthira's dad. Yudhisthira's dad was Pando. That's why Yudhisthira and his brothers are called the Pando's. Their dad's name was Pando and him and his brothers are called the Pando's. And they might say Pandovas too, but we just say Pando's. So, when when!! When! When! When! When! When! When! When! When! When! When! because now we've got to go to sleep. Okay? We talked for one minute.",
