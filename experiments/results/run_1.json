  "text": " Okay, what is the question? Dad, why do the Pandus and the Kauravas want to be king? Why do the Pandus and the Kauravas want to be king? Uh-huh. Well. Well. So the oldest brother of the Kauravas, his name was, do you remember? Duryodhana. Duryodhana, yeah. And the oldest brother of the Pandus, his name is? Yudhishthira. That's right, Yudhishthira. And so the Pandus and the Kauravas, they both wanted to be king. Okay. Meaning they both wanted the oldest on both families to be the king. And because they both wanted the same thing, they got in lots of arguments and lots of fights and they were not nice to each other. Does that make sense? And the reason that... Yudhishthira wanted to be king and Duryodhana wanted to be king were not exactly the same. Duryodhana wanted to be king because he felt like he deserved it. Like it was supposed to be his. It was a little bit of his, not a little, it was a lot of his ego. And he was quite vain, just like James is, right? Duryodhana was... Duryodhana was... Really thought that he should be king because he was the best. And then remember I also said he was mad and resented that his father, that they had taken him away from being king. And I mean to his credit... The rich father. The blind father. His father, what, do you remember his father's name? The... The... The... Yeah, I have to look up the pronunciation. But remember he was born blind. And even though he was the older one, older than Pondo, they didn't let him be king in the beginning. And because... Because they took his... His being a king away... He... Duryodhana always felt like it wasn't fair. And to be honest, he thought it wasn't fair that Yudhisthira should be king. Because his dad at that point, Dhrashtra, his dad was king. So it didn't make sense to Duryodhana that he wasn't king. So, I mean, he wasn't a great guy. But it's not like you can't understand why he kind of felt like he should be king. You can relate to him. You can have what we call empathy for him. Now, Yudhisthira, on the other hand, he thought he should be king. Because his father had been made king. And then because his father... Had to go away... It was kind of... Huh? Yudhisthira's dad. Yudhisthira's dad was Pondo. That's why Yudhisthira and his brothers are called the Pondos. Their dad's name was Pondo. And him and his brothers are called the Pondos. And they might say Pondovas too, but... Oh, we just say Pondos. So... So... When... So Yudhisthira, his whole life was like, well, I'm supposed to be king. Everybody told him he was supposed to be king. You know, he kind of knew that he was, like, good king material. You know? He knew he would probably be a good king and a fair king for the most part. So he thought it was his right to be king. He thought he would be a good king. And, I mean, he generally... Wanted to do right by people. I think there were a lot of times when he... When he said it would be okay if he wasn't king. But I also think he kind of felt like he should be king. So they both wanted to be king for kind of a lot of reasons. I just told you all the reasons. Well, I... We can talk about it again tomorrow. Because now we got to go to sleep. Okay? We talked for one minute. Okay.",
