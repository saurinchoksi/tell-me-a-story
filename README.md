# Tell Me A Story

A local pipeline for capturing and organizing bedtime stories.

**Status:** Just started. Working on the backend first.

## What it will do

- Record audio of storytelling sessions
- Transcribe with speaker labels (who said what)
- Extract story elements (characters, worlds, plot beats)
- Build a searchable story bible for reference

## Principles

- **Local only.** No cloud, no API keys for family content.
- **Zero latency.** Capture should disappear. Surface what I need without friction.
- **Hard fun.** Building this is the learning.

## Progress

See [docs/journal/](docs/journal/) for the build log.
