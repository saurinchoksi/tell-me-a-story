## Qwen3 8B

**Error:** No CORRECTED: delimiter found in output

### Raw Output

```
The dialogue appears to be a conversation between a parent (spk:1) and a child (spk:0). Based on the structure and context, the corrected version of the dialogue with speaker labels is as follows:

1. **<spk:0> Okay**, <spk:1> what is the question?  
   *(The child responds to the parent's question with "Okay.")*

2. **<spk:0> Why** do the Fondos and the Goros want to be king?  
   *(The child asks the question, with the parent (spk:1) potentially prompting or guiding the conversation.)*

3. **<spk:1> Well.** So the oldest brother of the [spk:0] his name was, do you remember?  
   *(The parent asks the child a follow-up question.)*

4. **<spk:0> Turioden.**  
   *(The child answers the parent's question.)*

5. **<spk:1> And** the oldest brother of the Pondos, his name is?  
   *(The parent continues the conversation.)*

6. **<spk:0> Yudhishthira.**  
   *(The child answers again.)*

### Key Assumptions:
- The parent (spk:1) initiates questions, and the child (spk:0) responds.
- The line **"why do the Fondos..."** is the child's question, as it follows the parent's prompt ("Okay, what is the question?").
- The **[spk:0]** in the parent's line is a placeholder for the child's name or a reference to the child's answer, which the child then provides.

This structure reflects a typical parent-child dialogue where the parent asks questions and the child provides answers.

## DeepSeek R1 8B

**Error:** Timeout after 300s

## Gemma 3 12B

**Time:** 34.2s

### Reasoning

```
The unknown markers are scattered throughout the conversation, primarily after interjections or questions. Given the conversational context, most likely the parent is prompting the child with questions and reactions, while the child is providing the answers. I'll assign <spk:?> to the unknown markers, then assign the speaker accordingly based on the flow of the conversation.
