## Qwen3 8B

**Error:** No CORRECTED: delimiter found in output

### Raw Output

```
The conversation alternates between the parent (spk:1) asking questions and the child (spk:0) providing answers. Here's the breakdown of the transcript with speaker assignments:

---

**1.**  
**<spk:0>** Okay,  
**<spk:1>** what is the question?  

**2.**  
**<spk:1>** why  
**<spk:0>** do the Fondos  
**<spk:1>** and  
**<spk:0>** the Goros want  
**<spk:1>** to  
**<spk:0>** be king?  

**3.**  
**<spk:0>** Uh  
**<spk:1>** -huh.  
**<spk:1>** Well.  
**<spk:1>** So the oldest brother of the  
**<spk:1>** his  
**<spk:1>** name was, do you remember?  
**<spk:0>** Turioden.  
**<spk:1>** Turioden, yeah.  
**<spk:0>** And  
**<spk:1>** the oldest brother of the Pondos, his name is?  
**<spk:0>** Yudhishthira.  
**<spk:1>** That's right, Yudhishthira.  
**<spk:0>** And  
**<spk:1>** so  
**<spk:1>** the  
**<spk:1>** Pondos  
**<spk:1>** and  
**<spk:1>** the Goros,  
**<spk:1>** they  
**<spk:1>** both...  
**<spk:0>** [unintelligible]  

---

### Key Observations:
- **Parent (spk:1)** asks questions, often starting with "why" or "do you remember?".
- **Child (spk:0)** provides answers, usually in the form of direct responses or clarifications.
- The `<spk:?>` markers are resolved by identifying whether the line contains a question (parent) or an answer (child). For example:
  - **"why do the Fondos..."** is a question from the parent.
  - **"do the Fondos..."** is an answer from the child, likely repeating or clarifying the parent's question.
  - **"Uh -huh."** is a child's hesitation or acknowledgment.
  - **"Turioden."** is a direct answer to the parent's question about the brother's name.

This structure reflects a typical parent-child interaction where the parent guides the conversation and the child responds.
```

## DeepSeek R1 8B

**Time:** 35.6s

### Reasoning

```
REASONING:
The parent asks questions and provides information, while the child answers questions and recalls names. The hesitation "Uh -huh" is likely the parent acknowledging the child's question.
```

### Corrected Transcript

```
<spk:0> Okay, <spk:1> what is the question? <spk:0> do the Fondos <spk:1> and <spk:0> the Goros want <spk:1> to <spk:0> be king? <spk:0> Uh <spk:1> -huh. <spk:1> Well. So the oldest brother of the <spk:1> his <spk:1> name was, do you remember? <spk:0> Turioden. <spk:1> Turioden, yeah. <spk:0> And <spk:1> the oldest brother of the Pondos, his name is? <spk:0> Yudhishthira. <spk:1> That's right, Yudhishthira. <spk:0> And <spk:1> so <spk:0> the <spk:1> Pondos <spk:0> and <spk:1> the Goros, <spk:0> they <spk:1> both... <spk:0> [unintelligible]

## Gemma 3 12B

**Time:** 29.0s

### Reasoning

```
REASONING:
The transcript shows a parent asking questions and a child answering. The initial "Okay" and questions likely come from the parent, while the "Uh-huh" and answers are from the child.
```

### Corrected Transcript

```
