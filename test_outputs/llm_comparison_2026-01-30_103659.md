## DeepSeek R1 8B

**Time:** 70.9s

### Reasoning

```
**Reasoning:**

1.  The conversation appears to be between a parent (<spk:1>) guidiStarted out giving it certain speakers aligned to certain utterances, and I think we only want to address the question marks. We don't want it to sit there and think it needs to make any updates to ones that are already utterances that are assigned to any speakers. ng a story and a child (<spk:0>) recalling details or answering questions.
2.  The parent asks questions, prompts memory, and makes statements, while the child answers or provides names.
3.  The initial `<spk:?> Okay, <spk:1> what is the question?` suggests the parent starts by asking a question ("what is the question?"). The child's answer ("Okay") is likely the response to this prompt. The following questions ("why do the Fondos...") are clearly asked by the parent (<spk:1>).
4.  The backchannel "Uh" is likely the parent hesitating or thinking aloud after the child's question.
5.  The backchannel "-huh" is likely the child acknowledging the parent's response or question.
6.  The parent then asks the child for a name, and the child provides it (<spk:0> Turioden). The parent confirms it (<spk:1> Turioden, yeah).
7.  The parent continues asking the child for the name of the other family (<spk:1> the oldest brother of the Pondos, his name is?). The child answers (<spk:0> Yudhishthira). The parent confirms (<spk:1> That's right, Yud.).
8.  The parent continues the story (<spk:1> And so the Pondos...).
9.  The unintelligible word is kept as is since its speaker is unclear and context doesn't resolve it definitively.

Assigning `<spk:?>` to `<spk:1>` or `<spk:0>` where the speaker is clearly the parent or child, respectively, based on the conversational flow.

### Reasoning

```
The initial transcript has many ambiguous speaker assignments. The conversation is clearly a parent (likely <spk:0>) asking questions to a child (likely <spk:1>). I've adjusted the speaker assignments based on the question-answer pattern throughout the dialogue. I've also assigned some short interjections like "Uh" and "mm-hmm" to the listener, which is likely the child.
